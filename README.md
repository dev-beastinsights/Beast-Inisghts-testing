# BI Automation Testing Framework
A comprehensive end-to-end testing framework for Beast Insights BI platform using Playwright and JavaScript. This framework automates testing of various BI features including reporting, BIN routing, user management, filters, theme switching, and password reset flows.

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Primary programming language with ES Modules
- **Playwright** (v1.54.1) - End-to-end testing framework
- **Node.js** (v16+) - Runtime environment
- **dotenv** (v17.2.1) - Environment variable management
- **imap-simple** (v5.1.0) - IMAP email client for password reset testing
- **mailparser** (v3.7.5) - Email parsing for verification flows

## üöÄ Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# 3. Create .env file with your credentials
echo "USERNAME=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password
USERNAME1=your_secondary_username
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_password" > .env

# 4. Run tests
npx playwright test

# 5. View test report
npx playwright show-report
```

## üìã Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git** (for version control)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Install Playwright browsers**

## üöÄ Running Tests
### Run All Tests
```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npx playwright test tests/BIN-routing.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/reporting.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/users.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/filter.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/dark-light-theme.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/export-embedded-visuals.spec.js
npx playwright test tests/forgot-password.spec.js
```

### Run Tests in Headed Mode (Visible Browser)
```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

### Run Tests in Debug Mode
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Run Tests with Specific Browser
```bash
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```
**Note**: Currently only Chromium is configured. Firefox and WebKit are commented out in `playwright.config.js`.

## üìä Test Reports
After running tests, you can view detailed reports:
1. **HTML Report**
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-report
   ```
   This opens an HTML report in your browser showing test results, screenshots, and videos.
2. **Report Location**
   - HTML Report: `playwright-report/index.html`
   - Screenshots: `test-results/` directory
   - Videos: `test-results/` directory

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
### Playwright Configuration
The `playwright.config.js` file contains:
- **Test Directory**: `./tests`
- **Base URL**: `https://app.beastinsights.co/`
- **Timeout**: 90 seconds (90000ms)
- **Retries**: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
- **Workers**: 2 parallel workers locally, 1 on CI
- **Fully Parallel**: Tests run in parallel mode
- **Browsers**: Chromium (Desktop Chrome) - default and only enabled browser
- **Screenshots**: `only-on-failure`
- **Videos**: `retain-on-failure`
- **Traces**: `on-first-retry`
- **Reporters**: 
  - List reporter (console output)
  - HTML reporter (`playwright-report/index.html`)

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with:
```env
USERNAME=your_beast_insights_username
PASSWORD=your_beast_insights_password
USERNAME1=your_secondary_username_for_password_reset
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your_gmail_app_specific_password
```

### Adding New Utilities
1. Create utility functions in the `utils/` directory
2. Export functions using ES6 module syntax
3. Import utilities in test files as needed
4. Keep utilities focused and reusable (dates, downloads, filters, etc.)

## üêõ Troubleshooting
### Common Issues

1. **Browser Installation Issues**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install --force
   ```

2. **Environment Variables Not Loading**
   - Ensure `.env` file is in the root directory
   - Check variable names match exactly: `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `USERNAME1`, `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`
   - Restart your terminal/IDE after creating/modifying `.env`
   - Verify `dotenv.config()` is called in test files

3. **Test Timeouts**
   - Default timeout is 90 seconds (90000ms)
   - Increase timeout in `playwright.config.js` if needed
   - Check network connectivity to `https://app.beastinsights.co/`
   - Verify base URL is accessible

4. **Login Issues**
   - Verify credentials in `.env` file are correct
   - Check if the application is accessible
   - Ensure no 2FA is required

### Debug Mode
Run tests in debug mode to step through execution:
```bash
npx playwright test --debug
```
